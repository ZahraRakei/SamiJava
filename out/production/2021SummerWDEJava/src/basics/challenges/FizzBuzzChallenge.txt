***FIZZ BUZZ CHALLENGE***

Create a method, called fizzBuzz() that accepts 1 parameter of type int
The method should return "Fizz", "Buzz" or "FizzBuzz" (Only one of them, not all)

    If the number is a multiple of 3 the output should be "Fizz".
    If the number given is a multiple of 5, the output should be "Buzz".
    If the number given is a multiple of both 3 and 5, the output should be "FizzBuzz".
    If the number is not a multiple of either 3 or 5, the number should be output on its own (as a string),
        as shown in the examples below:

        Examples:
            fizzBuzz(3) ➞ "Fizz"

            fizzBuzz(5) ➞ "Buzz"

            fizzBuzz(15) ➞ "FizzBuzz"

            fizzBuzz(4) ➞ "4"

    The value that is returned should always be a string, even if it is not a multiple of 3 or 5.
