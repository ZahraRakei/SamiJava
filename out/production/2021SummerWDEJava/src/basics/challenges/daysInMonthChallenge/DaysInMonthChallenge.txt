Create a method that returns the number of days in a month, with the name of the month + the year, passed as arguments to the method
         STEPS
            1 - Write a method getDaysInMonth() which accepts 2 parameters of type int, called month and year
            2 - If the argument for month that is passed to the method is <1 or >12, return -1
            3 - If the argument for year that is passed to the method is <1 or >9999, then return -1
            4 - This method needs to return the number of days in a month
            ***BE CAREFUL ABOUT LEAP YEARS (29 days in month 2)
                Examples:
                getDaysInMonth(1, 2020) - Returns 31, since Jan has 31 days
                getDaysInMonth(2, 2020) - Returns 29
                getDaysInMonth(2, 2021) - Returns 28
                getDaysInMonth(-7, 2026) - Returns -1, since month parameter is invalid
                getDaysInMonth(2, -2020) - Returns -1, since parameter year is outside of range (1-9999)

            5 - Write a method isLeapYear() with a parameter of type int named year
            6 - The argument needs to be greater than or equal to 1 AND less than or equal to 9999.
                If the argument is not in that range, return false
            7 - Otherwise, if itâ€™s in the valid range, calculate if year is a leap year, and return true if it is

                HINT: A year is a leap year if it is divisible by 4, but not by 100 OR if it is divisible by 400
                Examples:
                isLeapYear(-1600) - Returns false, since the argument is not within the range
                isLeapYear(1600) - Returns true
                isLeapYear(2022) - Returns false, since 2022 is not a leap year
                isLeapYear(2020) - Returns true
